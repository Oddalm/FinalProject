                <p class = soltekst> We want to build recycling centres in the outskirts of all cities across the whole
                  world. Not only the big cities, but also in between smaller cities to make the solution accessible for
                  everyone. These centres will be easy to use, and we will develop a database with a user-friendly
                  software which tracks the amount of trash you individually have recycled. For those with smartphones
                  we will also develop an app which will do the same thing, but you will have access to see your amount
                  without going there physically, as well as a map to see where your closest centre is located.</p>

              <p class = soltekst> In these centres you can submit your waste, either plastic or glass by recycling.
                In these centres you can submit your waste, either plastic or glass by recycling. When you have recycled
                a given amount of trash you get a given amount of score/currency. This score or currency can be used in
                our centres to retrieve a reward. The reward depends on your wish, it can be anything from bread to real
                life money.  </p>

              <p class="soltekst"> In short, gathering plastic and glass will give the citizen a reward.
                This solution will be worth it for everyone, since it affects you as an individual and the world for the better. </p>
