              <h1>The solution</h1>
                <p class = soltekst> We want to build recycling centres in the outskirts of all cities across the whole world.
                  Not only the big cities, but also in between smaller cities to make the solution accessible for
                  everyone. These centres will be easy to use, and we will develop a database with a user-friendly
                  software which tracks the amount of trash you individually have recycled. For those with smartphones
                  we will also develop a type off app which will do the same thing, but you will have access to see your
                  amount without going there physically, as well as a map to see where your closest centre is. </p>
              <p class = soltekst> In these centres you can submit your waste, either plastic or glass by recycling.
                When you have recycled “x” amount of trash you get “y” amount of score/currency. This score/currency
                you can use in the centre to retrieve a reward. The reward depends on your wish, it can be anything
                from bread to real life money in your country.  </p>
              <p class="soltekst"> In short, gathering plastic and glass will give the citizen a reward. By doing this
                recycling will be worth it to every individual since it affects everyone and everything for the positive. </p>
