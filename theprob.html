              <p>
Production and development of thousands of new plastic products accelerated after World War II,
and the production continues to increase. Plastic is cheap and it is very resistant,
 very good for light and cheap products, not so good for the environment. A plastic bag you use one day,
 and do not sort, can be in nature for millions of years. </p>
 <p> The production and incineration of the plastic itself are large parts of the climate challenge we face today.
   Greenhouse gases equivalent to 850 million tonnes are emitted as a result of production, every single year.
   It is not only the atmosphere that is affected, but also us who live within it.
   Marine wildlife in particular are affected, either by eating it, being harmed by it, or getting stuck.
    Us humans as well get affected. There is even plastic in the food we eat, and the water we drink.
     In developing countries, where there is often a lack of recycling, there are large amounts of plastic in the water.
     This results in contaminated drinking water. </p>
              <br>
               <h2> The solution is to prevent plastic waste from entering rivers and seas in the first place,
        many scientists and conservationists—the National Geographic Society—say. </h2>
