      <h1>THE PLASTIC VALUTA PROJECT</h1>
          <p>Figures from 2018 show that approximately <b>380 million tonnes of plastic </b> are produced each year, 
        and most of the plastic is released into the environmentPlastic pollution has in recent years become one of the biggest environmental problems we have.
        We are seeing more and more beaches covered in plastic and even more injured marine animals,
        and this continues to increase. Researchers suggest that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. 
        The consumption of plastic is enormous, and far too few measures have been taken to reduce this, but why is it so?</p>
